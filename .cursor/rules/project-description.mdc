description: This project fixes MP3 file sorting problems for children's MP3 players and basic audio devices. Common issue with audiobooks from stores where files named 1.mp3, 2.mp3, ..., 10.mp3 play in wrong order (1, 10, 11, 2, 3...) confusing children. Solution: renames files with zero-padding (001.mp3, 002.mp3, 010.mp3) and updates ID3 track tags for perfect playback order. Includes native macOS GUI app with drag & drop for easy use by parents preparing audiobooks for kids.
